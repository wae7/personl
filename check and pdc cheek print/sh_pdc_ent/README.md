About
============
In Invoice/Bill, a post-dated cheque is a cheque written by the customer/vendor (payer) for a date in the future. Whether a post-dated cheque may be cashed or deposited before the date written on it depends on the country. Currently, odoo does not provide any kind of feature to manage post-dated cheque. That why we make this module, it will help to manage a post-dated cheque with an accounting journal entries. This module provides a feature to Register PDC Cheque in an account. This module allows to manage postdated cheque for the customer as well vendors, you can easily track/move to a different state of cheque like new, registered, return, deposit, bounce, done. We have taken care of all states with accounting journal entries, You can easily list filter cheque with different states. We have also made simple pdf reports.
